# Synthetic Color-Magnitude Diagram generator
This is the release repo for my synthetic CMD project that I did for my [undergrad astronomy thesis](https://doi.org/10.18130/wh4a-bt41). It serves as an interface between the [Astropy SPISEA package] as described in [Hosek et al. 2020](doi.org/10.3847/1538-3881/aba533), and the Nbody6++ protocluster simulations as described in [Farias et al. 2018](10.1093/mnras/sty3470), to create a diagram of the forecasted appearance of a forming star cluster.

This only contains iterations of the software and does not have any development/test code for the sake of keeping the repository clean. If you'd like to see my dev code, please see the dev repo [synthetic-cmd-dev](github.com/zangston/synthetic-cmd-dev).
